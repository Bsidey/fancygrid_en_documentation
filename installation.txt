FancyGrid is plugin-free library, it does not depend on other libraries, but it integrates with jQuery, AngularJS, Sparklines and HighCharts chart libraries.
In this document you will learn how to include FancyGrid in your site.


Include FancyGrid
Include files from code.fancygrid.com
Include the JavaScript files in the <head> section of your web page as shown below.

<link href="http://code.fancygrid.com/fancy.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="http://code.fancygrid.com/fancy.min.js"></script>

Include files from CDN
Include the JavaScript files in the <head> section of your web page as shown below.

<link href="http://cdn.fancygrid.com/fancy.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="http://cdn.fancygrid.com/fancy.min.js"></script>
<script>
Fancy.MODULESDIR="http://cdn.fancygrid.com/modules/";
</script>

Alternatively, you can load the files from your own domain
Download Latest Build and include files to your page.

<link href="/fancygrid/fancy.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="/fancygrid/fancy.min.js"></script>

FancyGrid has an intelligent modules system that
auto detects and loads all the needed modules by itself. 
If you include files from own domain then set the modules directory url within a script tag.

<script>
Fancy.MODULESDIR = '/fancygrid/modules/';
</script>

By default, it is set from the code site:

Fancy.MODULESDIR = 'https://code.fancygrid.com/modules/';

Full built
Another way of including FancyGrid is to use the full built files.
In this case the modules system will not be loaded. The trade off is that the full size files are larger.

<link href="/fancygrid/fancy.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="/fancygrid/fancy.full.min.js"></script>

Bower
Run the following command to start your download.
bower install fancygrid

Integration

JQuery
FancyGrid is integrated with jQuery.
If jQuery is included on the page then FancyGrid will switch to use it's API.

Include jQuery on the page within a script tag.

<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js"></script>

For Chart samples
To use chart integration, include HighCharts.

<script src="http://code.highcharts.com/highcharts.js"></script>

To use sparklines, download and include the sparkline library (jQuery library).

Get Started
Your page will look similar to this:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        
        <title>Your Title here</title>
        
        <link href="http://code.fancygrid.com/fancy.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
        <link rel="shortcut icon" href="css/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">        
        
        <!-- <script src="js/jquery-3.1.1.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script> -->
        <script src="http://code.fancygrid.com/fancy.min.js"></script>
                
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="container"></div>
    </body>
</html>
